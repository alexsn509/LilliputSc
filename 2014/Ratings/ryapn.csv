;,"The RYA Portsmouth Yardstick Scheme is provided to enable clubs to allow boats of different classes to race against each other fairly. The RYA actively encourages clubs to adjust handicaps where classes are either under or over performing compared to the number being used. 
The Portsmouth Yardstick list combines the Portsmouth numbers with class configuration and the total number of races returned to the RYA in the annual return. This additional data has been provided to help clubs achieve the stated aims of the Portsmouth Yardstick system and make adjustments to Portsmouth Numbers where necessary. Clubs using the PN list should be aware that the list is based on the average performance of each boat across a variety of clubs and locations. The numbers in the PN list may not reflect the peak performance of each boat.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
;,Experimental numbers are based on fewer returns and are to be used as a guide for clubs to allocate a starting number for either new or development classes. Any number issued by a club should be reviewed and adjusted where necessary at the clubs discretion. The list of experimental Portsmouth Numbers will be periodically reviewed by the RYA and is based on data received from the PY Online website (www.pys.org.uk).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
;,Users of the PY scheme are reminded that all Portsmouth Numbers published by the RYA should be regarded as a guide only. The RYA list is not definitive and clubs should adjust where necessary.

;,"For any catamaran classes that do not appear on this list but that have a published SCHRS number on http://www.schrs.com/ratings.php it is possible to use a conversion factor of 675 as agreed between the Portsmouth Yardstick Group and SCHRS Technical Committee. To convert from SCHRS to PY, simply multiply the SCHRS number by 675 e.g:             Tornado = 0.939(SCHRS) x 675 = 634 (PY)                                                                                                               If using the conversion factor please return results to http://www.pys.org.uk using the correct class designation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
